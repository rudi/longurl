* What is it?

This is a package for the Emacs text editor that uses the API of
http://longurl.org/ to expand the abbreviated URLs often found on
twitter or in mail messages.  

* Using it
 
There are two main entry points:
 
- =M-x longurl-expand= takes an URL to expand and returns the expanded
  URL and, when called interactively, also displays it in the echo area.
 
- =M-x longurl-expand-at-point= replaces the URL at point with the
  expanded URL.  If you find yourself using it often, you can add a
  keybinding for added convenience:

: (global-set-key (kbd "C-c e") 'longurl-expand-at-point)

  (Key combinations =C-c= + letter are reserved for the user in Emacs.)
 
- Additionally, =longurl-list-services= returns a list of all services
  (=is.gd=, =tinyurl.com=, ...) that =longurl.org= knows how to expand.
